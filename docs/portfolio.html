        <h2>C# Class Projects</h2>
        <hr>
        <p1>
            Below are a few projects I have developed in C# while I have been at Grand Circus.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Hiruberk/BlockBusterSimulation" target="_blank">BlockBuster Simulation App:</a><br> This allows a user to watch through a scenes of a movie that they can check out at a "BlockBuster". 
                This project utilized more Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) than my earlier projects and it gave me a good understanding into the power it can provide. It includes both DVD and VHS selections and prompts user if they will rewind the VHS tapes. 
                There is a fun feature where I used threading to simulate a scene at a time full movie experience, at least as much as you can inside a terminal window.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Hiruberk/PigLatinCapstone" target="_blank">PigLatin Translator:</a><br>
                This was an early app I developed. It is used to translate english into Pig Latin. It will ignore numbers and anything with a special character, while passing through puncuation.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Hiruberk/TaskListCapstone" target="_blank">Task List App:</a><br>
                A look at my first project using OOP. An app used to log and assign tasks or "To-Dos" to people with due dates. It comes with preset tasks to display the functionality. In the future I plan on implementing searching or grouping by due date and adding people to assign to.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Hiruberk/RegExValidation/tree/main/RegExLab7" target="_blank">Password Validation:</a><br>
                My first look into using Regex as a validation method to for emails, phone numbers and the date. Regex is a beast of a tool to use
                it is an eye sore. However, I know it has very valuable applications among validation.
            </li>
        </ul>
