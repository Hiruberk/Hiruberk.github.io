            Hello!<br>
            I am Nathaniel Davis, I got by Nate for short. Welcome to my webpage where I showcase all of my projects in the software development field.

            I grew up and went to school in Metro Detroit, before moving 9 hours north to the Keeweenaw Penisula to attend Michigan Technological University (MTU).
            I decided to become an environmental engineer. I chose this school because I have always interested in nature and the enviroment. Even at a young age I was enrolled in the cub scouts, which led down a apth where I earned my Eagle Scout rank
             within the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Being apart of that organization brought me a lot of quality time with the outdoors.

            I graduated from MTU with honors. I started pursing work pertaining to my hard-earned degree, which proved to be far and rare in between. I moved down to Metro Flint then further South back to Metro Detroit. After years of working jobs that were not fulfilling I decided to take a leap of faith.
            I enrolled in Grand Circus, which I am currently attending, to learn C#, .NET Back-End Devloping tools and be able to jump-start a new career.

            I have always been a hard-working, determined person. My background with BSA taught me team building skills and leadership roles.
            Something I have always prided myself on is my adaptive ability to learn quickly. I would love to share my talents, skills and abilities with a like-minded employer.
