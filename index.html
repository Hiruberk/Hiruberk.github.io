        <h2>My Hometown</h2>
        <p. class="tab">
            My early childhood (prior to 2nd grade) I moved around a good amount from Milford, MI to Lathrup Village, MI and my memories are few from these areas. My hometown is where I went to the majority of my primary education and that is in a small, quaint city, Berkley, MI.
            Not to be confused with the large city in California. Instead my city was located just outside Detroit positioned between 11 mile and 13 mile rds and between Southfield and Royal Oak. Over the years gentrification of Detroit's outer suburbs have given
            way to this area becoming more affluent and progressive. However, when I was growing up there it was not this way, at least not to the extreme it is currently. I would describe it as a generic suburb that is uncharactestically safe for being only a few miles from one of the most reoccurent dangerous cities in America.
            Please don't take away that I do not enjoy spending time in Detroit, it has a very stigmatic view pointed at it from people outside of the surrounding areas. I loved my hometown and the boons it was able to provide me. My high school was highly ranked when I went there and I was able to get a full rounded education and played sports when I could.
            Berkley, is a simple town that is bland on the outside, but comforting and kind on the inside. I would be living there now if I could afford the astounding housing prices that have swarmed that area over the past decade.

        <h2>Hobbies Are a Look Into What Makes Someone Tick</h2>
        <p. class="tab">
            I grew up doing a few different things: sports, camping and video games.
            As I have grown up I have stopped playing as many sports only pick up games when I can.
            Otherwise camping and video games take up most of my free time. My most recent camping
            destionation was up in the Upper Penisula of Michigan at a campsite named after the Trout River 
            that was just off of Lake Superior. You can see the campsite (here) (do not take the Google Maps directions!). 
            I took the Google Maps direction and it led me to a reclaimed forestfire land that was full of sand, destroyed trees, and brush. 
            It was an adventure like any other and luckily my car did not bottom out too hard and break an axle.<br><br>
            As for video games, my current favorite is Valheim, a Nordic themed survival game mirroring Minecraft.
            I love almost all Genres of video games, but a few series that really stand out to me are:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Doom, a Fast-Paced First Person Shooter (FPS). If you have not played the new games I highly recommend them as some of the best games ever developed.</li>
                <li>Fallout, a FPS Role-Playing Game (RPG), in particular New Vegas stole my heart and stands above them all in that series.</li>
                <li>Civlization (in particular, the 5th), a turn based city building game. It is quite in depth, but I have lost so much time to this game and I don't regret it in the slightest. </li>
                <li>World of Warcraft, a Massive Online Multiplayer RPG (MMORPG) a special item on this list. It was what consumed most of time in early High School and Middle School. I put in upwards of a half year of in-game time and Built a lot of really great relationships with friends through the years.</li>
                <li>Tabletop Simulator, a virtual tabletop game simulator that has always been a guilty pleasure, you can simulate almost any board game and incorporate it into a virtual setting that friends can come into a lobby with you and play games. A very useful game in quarantine times.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>My Last Career and Why I Needed a Change</h2>
        <p. class="tab">
            Once upon a time I went to school to become an Environmental Engineer and a beautiful University that my parents went to, Michigan Technological University (MTU).
            Unfortunately what I did not plan for was that I would Graduate the same year that a lot of Regulations would be lightened and Federal Funding for the DEQ and EPA
            would be lessened. This posed a problem for my future career and with large student loans payments approaching I needed to find a job.
            I settled for a Mechanical Engineer orientated position involved with applications for Industrial Pumps.
            If you are unfamilar it is essentially industrial sized pumps that move, sewage, chemicals, freshwater, saltwater, any liquid of any sort.
            It is not the most exicting work, but Pumps are the world's most sold tools and will always be needed. What I needed was job security and 
            I had that in Industrial pumps, however, my heart was in a different place. I learned a lot of valuable things and built a few connections/relationships that
            will last.
        </p.> <br><br>
        <p. class="tab">
            I had been doing pumps for almost 4 years and in the last year the quarantine hit and Covid-19 was running rampant. My current company handled it poorly to say the least.
            They had been around since the mid 1900s and it showed with very little done to progress them towards the future. When remoting become the norm they had a hard time adjusting
            , which led to some people never being brought back, but instead were indefinite layoffs with no idea of a timetable. This scared me and gave me little hope about ascending the heirarchy.
            I wanted more from life and wanted more from my company. In a capitalistic focused society your employer can make or break your lifestyles and I thought I would start looking for other work.
            I had a few friends in the Software Developments field and they had pursued it through Grand Circus and I thought if they could, I could too!
            Then I started to plan to change carrers and really put myself out there. I have always loved to be on the computer and enjoyed progressive new inventions. Developing seemed
            like a familar and exciting way to change careers and try and get a stable lifestyle soemthing I have always wanted.

        <h2>Paving a New Path: Developing</h2>
        <p. class="tab">
            If a career change was not intimidating enough, the software developing career change involved a completely virtual and remote cultural that only intensified these fears. It was a complete upheavel and would test me in so many ways I had not foreseen.
            For one I had needed a good desk space as I would find out posture is very important at a full desk job and breaks have never been such a luxury. Over time I have come to realize that these are actually benefits and have really helped me in my thought process and
            overall mental health. Since the start of the year and our current week of the bootcamp, I have had more times for errands, chores, time with my loved ones, and for my hobbies. One would think that my list would stop there, but 
            really it has come from an unlocking of my learning abilities and a defogging of the monomonity that came from my past career. I feel more like myself back when I went to University and loved to learn and challenge myself.
            Even if for some reason a job does not pan out from this experience I will not regret the experience of stepping out of my comfort zone and leaving behind the complanency and the feeling of settling.
            I hope this only made you more interested in what I have to offer. Please if you have not check out my portfolio section and look at the GitHub repositories that are on that page.
